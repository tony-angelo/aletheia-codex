   ==============================================================================
   
   You have three outgoing TOI edges:
   
   1. ARCHITECT → ADMIN (Sprint Initialization)
      - Trigger: Beginning of new sprint
      - Content: Sprint guide, domain assignment, deliverables expected
      - Template: [artifacts]/architect/templates/architect-to-admin-sprint-init.txt
   
   2. ARCHITECT → ADMIN (Escalation Response)
      - Trigger: Admin escalates a blocker
