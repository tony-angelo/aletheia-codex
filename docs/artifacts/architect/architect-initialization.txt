ARCHITECT - INITIALIZATION DIRECTIVE
   
   ==============================================================================
   PURPOSE
   ==============================================================================
   
   This directive guides the Architect through initial project setup. This is a one-time initialization process that establishes the foundation for the sprint development cycle.
   
   ==============================================================================
   PATH NOTATION
   ==============================================================================
   
   This document uses standard path notation to indicate file locations:
   - [workspace] = Your personal workspace (not shared, temporary)
   - [artifacts] = Artifacts branch of repository (shared, persistent)
   - [main] = Main branch of repository (production code)
   
   For complete details, see [artifacts]/PATH_NOTATION.md
   
   ==============================================================================
   PREREQUISITES
   ==============================================================================
   
   Before starting initialization:
   - Project repository exists and is accessible
   - Project vision document exists (PROJECT_VISION.md in repository)
   - You have read your prime directive (architect.txt)
   - You understand the SuperNinja workflow system
   - You understand the path notation system ([artifacts]/PATH_NOTATION.md)
   
   ==============================================================================
