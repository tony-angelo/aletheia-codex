## Sprint 5 Context
Sprint 5 fixed a critical note processing workflow issue:
- Root cause: HTTP trigger instead of Firestore trigger
- Fix: Redeployed with proper Firestore trigger
- Result: Automatic AI extraction working
- Performance: < 3 seconds end-to-end
- Success rate: 100%

This sprint restored the core automation of the application.
