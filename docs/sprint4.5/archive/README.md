## Sprint 4.5 Context
Sprint 4.5 was a quick 3-hour sprint to replace mock authentication with real Firebase Authentication. This unblocked the entire application by enabling:
- Notes to persist to Firestore
- Review queue to work with authenticated users
- Proper security rule enforcement
- Multi-user support
