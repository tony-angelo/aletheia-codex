## 👤 User Action Required (15-20 minutes)

### Why User Action is Needed
The AI service account (`superninja@aletheia-codex-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) has limited permissions and cannot:
- Write to Firestore
- Create test documents
- Modify existing documents

Therefore, you need to complete the final testing steps.

### Step 1: Create Test Document (5 minutes)

**Option A: Firebase Console (Recommended)**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: **aletheia-codex-prod**
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
4. Create document in **documents** collection
5. Document ID: `test-ai-sprint2-final`
6. Add fields (see SPRINT2_USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md for details)

**Option B: Use Provided Scripts**
```bash
# Authenticate with your user account
gcloud auth login

# Run the helper script
cd aletheia-codex
./create_doc_rest.sh
```

### Step 2: Test the Function (5 minutes)
```bash
# Get authentication token
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)

# Call the function
curl -X POST \
  "https://us-central1-aletheia-codex-prod.cloudfunctions.net/orchestrate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"document_id": "test-ai-sprint2-final", "user_id": "test-user-sprint2"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Step 3: Verify Results (10 minutes)

**Check Firestore:**
- `review_queue` collection - Should have extracted entities and relationships
- `usage_logs` collection - Should have cost tracking entries
- `documents` collection - Document status should be updated

**Check Neo4j:**
- Entities should be created as nodes
- Relationships should be created as edges
- Graph should be queryable

**Check Logs:**
```bash
gcloud functions logs read orchestrate --region=us-central1 --limit=50
```

**See:** SPRINT2_USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md for detailed verification steps

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot create test document
**Solution:** Ensure you're authenticated with your user account (not service account):
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project aletheia-codex-prod
```

### Issue: Function returns error
**Solution:** Check function logs:
```bash
gcloud functions logs read orchestrate --region=us-central1 --limit=50
```

### Issue: No entities extracted
**Solution:** 
1. Verify Gemini API key in Secret Manager
2. Check function logs for AI service errors
3. Ensure document content has extractable entities

### Issue: No graph nodes created
**Solution:**
1. Verify Neo4j credentials in Secret Manager
