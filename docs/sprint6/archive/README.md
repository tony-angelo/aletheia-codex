## Original Documents (49+ files)

### Completion Reports
Multiple completion reports documenting various attempts and approaches

### Implementation Guides
- Authentication implementation guides
- CORS fix guides
- Custom domain setup guides
- API Gateway guides
- Load Balancer guides

### Status Reports
- Multiple status updates
- Deployment reports
- Blocker analyses
- Solution explorations

### Technical Documentation
- Architecture comparisons
- Security analyses
- Cost analyses
- Implementation details

## Why These Were Archived
Sprint 6 generated extensive documentation due to:
1. Multiple solution attempts (Firebase Auth, CORS, Custom Domain, etc.)
2. Organization policy blocker requiring multiple approaches
3. Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation
4. Detailed architecture analyses

All documents were consolidated to provide:
1. A clear narrative of the sprint (summary)
2. Specific objectives and scope (goal)
3. Issues and solutions (troubleshooting)
4. Results and metrics (outcome)

All information from the original documents has been preserved in the consolidated versions.

## Sprint 6 Context
Sprint 6 attempted to build UI foundation with authentication:
- Technical implementation: Complete
- Code quality: High
- Production blocker: Organization policy
- Recommended solution: Load Balancer + Identity-Aware Proxy
- Status: Technically complete, blocked by infrastructure

This sprint demonstrated the importance of checking organization policies early and having enterprise-grade solutions ready.
